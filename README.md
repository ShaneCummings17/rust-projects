# rust-projects
This repository contains various small rust projects I have done while learning the language.

List from: https://cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/3473/

1. Find the factorial of a number entered by the user. (check for all conditions).

2. Write a currency converter from Euro to Dollar and vice versa.

3. Write a program that prints out a triangle from smallest to largest; user inputs bottom number.

4. Develop a program that uses a randomly generated number to select 1 of 3 (or more) functions to show the user.

5. Guessing game. Write a game that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and a 100. If you guessed correctly, it will say you win. If your too high or too low it will also let you know.

6. Create a program which generates Fibonacci series till a number 'n' where 'n' is entered by the user. For eg. if the user enters 10 then the output would be: 1 1 2 3 5 8.

7. Determine how many of the characters are vowels and how many are consonants in a given line of text. Also terminate the string when the input character encountered is other than the alphabets.
